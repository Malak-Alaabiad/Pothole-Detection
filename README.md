# Pothole-detection-using-Computer-Vision-

Build a computer vision-based technology to process and detect the potholes present in an image.
This is my first object detection - computer vision 

From the notebook starter, I have tried the same PyTorch - fasterrcnn resnet50 fpn object detection model, and without the proper image processing or data augmentation the model not performed well and didn't learn any signals.
